# Fishing Macro

Made for use in the game [Arcane Odyssey](https://www.roblox.com/games/3272915504/Arcane-Odyssey-Early-Access) on Roblox.

To use, pip install all the libraries and run it.
The program detects red pixels in a square at the center of the game window, so make sure to position your camera in the correct place, and avoid being near anything red. Tolerance and radius may need to be adjusted.
To assist in troubleshooting, the program creates a png file of the screenshot region in the project that you can use as a reference to help adjust the size of detection based on the game window & your screen size.

To stop the macro, press the ` key, and pause it by pressing the = key.

If you'd like to add an alert sound if the macro detects that it is stuck (which is generally caused by a lag spike), set the bool play_alarm to True.
You can also add your own sound by either replacing the alert sound in this project, or replacing the path to the sound you want played.

*Please note that using this tool unattended is against the rules of the game and you may be banned.*
